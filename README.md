# Frequency Energy Response Optimiser and Simulator (FEROS)

## About

This is a standalone application designed for Windows OS that uses a system frequency model to simulate and optimise system frequency based on user defined scenarios. The specific functions of the application include:

1. optimise frequency response services;
2. simulate system frequency;
3. conduct studies that facilitate the design of frequency response services;
4. conduct studies pertaining inertia spread and frequency response requirements;
5. conduct studies pertaining to system non-synchronous penetration limits; and
6. conduct studies to retrospectively estimate some of the parameters associated with the state of a power system at the time of a frequency event.
