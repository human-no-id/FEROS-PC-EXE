## About

This is a standalone application designed for Windows OS that uses a system frequency model to simulate and optimise system frequency based on user defined scenarios. The application is capable of:

1. optimising frequency response services;
2. simulating system frequency;
3. conducting studies that facilitate the design of frequency response services;
4. conducting studies pertaining to inertia spread and frequency response requirements;
5. conducting studies pertaining to system non-synchronous penetration limits; and
6. conducting studies to retrospectively estimate some of the parameters associated with the state of a power system at the time of a frequency event.
